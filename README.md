# Bedrock Pre-reqs

### 1. Subscription
- You need an azure subscription where you are an owner

### 2. Azure Dev Ops 
- Access to Azure Dev Ops Organization where you can create projects. We will be using this to setup Dev Ops Pipelines

### 3. Other tools
Bedrock uses several tools to automate cluster deployments that you'll need to install if you don't already have them:
- Azure Cli [Azure CLI install guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).  
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) Bedrock currently uses [Terraform 0.12.6](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.6/).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)
